    <h3>Karate (Striking Arts)</h3>
    <p>Karate is a traditional martial art originating from Okinawa, Japan. It developed from indigenous fighting methods combined with Chinese martial arts, forming a system focused on striking techniques.</p>
    <p>The art emphasizes punches, kicks, knee strikes, and open-hand techniques. Practitioners learn forms (kata), basic drills (kihon), and sparring (kumite) to develop power and control.</p>
    <p>Karate promotes discipline, respect, and perseverance. Its philosophy centers around self-improvement, mental focus, and peaceful resolution of conflict whenever possible.</p>

    <p>Techniques include strikes, joint locks, throws, and pressure point applications. It is taught as both a physical discipline and a philosophical study.</p>
    <p>Its core philosophy centers on mutual respect, cooperation, and building a peaceful society through strong individuals. The motto is: "Half for one's own happiness, and half for the happiness of others."</p>

    <p>It includes kicks, joint locks, throws, pressure point strikes, and weapon training. Unlike hard-style arts, Hapkido emphasizes circular motion and redirection of force.</p>
    <p>The philosophy of Hapkido promotes harmony, non-resistance, and balance. It teaches that true strength lies in flexibility and awareness, both physically and mentally.</p>

    <p>Judo, meaning "the gentle way", was founded in Japan by Jigoro Kano in 1882. It evolved from traditional Japanese jujutsu systems into a modern Olympic sport.</p>
    <p>It focuses on throwing techniques, pins, and submissions such as arm locks and chokes. Judokas learn to use leverage and timing rather than brute strength.</p>
    <p>Judo's philosophy encourages mutual welfare and benefit. Practitioners strive for efficient movement and continuous self-improvement through rigorous practice and humility.</p>
